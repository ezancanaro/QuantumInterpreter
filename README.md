## QuantumInterpreter
# Dependencies:

Module Data.Matrix
Module Numeric.Fixed

Both can be installed via cabal after a cabal update.

cabal install matrix
cabal install fixed

The monadic version uses Flexible and Overlapping Instances pragmas, defined for the GHC compiler.

# Description

This project includes 2 implementations of a Typechecker for a functional reversible language with Quantum Control. The first version is implemented by the use of pure functions, threading the typing contexts throughout the function calls.

The second version was built relying on the State Monad to keep our contexts consistent. Both versions show the exact same behaviour, being complemented by the same evaluation routines in file Semantics.hs

Mostly, the differing implementations were meant as an experiment in the different Haskell styles, in regards to ease of source code comprehension and function prototyping. Monadic Style has the advantage of reducing the overcrowding of arguments on function calls and very explicitly showing equations that modify the state.

On the other hand, the pure version makes manipulating the contexts simpler, since the functional approach to values makes all modifications local to the subtree generated by each function call.
